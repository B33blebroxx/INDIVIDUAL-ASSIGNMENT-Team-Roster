Here I am putting an overview of what my project is about. It comes below the name of my project so that others can read what it is about and get more details.

[View App](#your-link)

## About the User 
- The ideal user for this application is a sports fan
- They have a desire to create their own teams and the players to populate them
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to manage their fantasy rosters.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a new player or team is added an object should be created and that object should be pushed into an array of players or teams that then prints to the DOM.
- Search players by name or role.
